# Call Helm - Investor FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions from Investors

---

### PRODUCT & TECHNOLOGY

#### Q: What exactly does Call Helm do?
**A:** Call Helm is a white-label voice services platform that transforms any business into a sophisticated call center in 5 minutes. We provide instant phone number provisioning, AI-powered call scripts, real-time monitoring, and complete call center infrastructure at 75% less cost than traditional solutions.

#### Q: How is this different from Twilio or other APIs?
**A:** Twilio provides raw infrastructure APIs that require significant development. Call Helm is a complete, ready-to-use application with UI, AI integration, user management, billing, analytics, and white-label capabilities. Think of Twilio as AWS and Call Helm as Shopify - we've built the application layer that businesses actually need.

#### Q: What's your technical moat?
**A:** Our moat consists of:
1. **AI Integration**: Deep GPT-4 integration for script generation and call analysis
2. **Real-time Architecture**: WebSocket-based live monitoring unique in SMB market
3. **Multi-provider Abstraction**: Seamlessly switch between carriers without code changes
4. **White-label Infrastructure**: Complete rebranding capability including domains
5. **Compliance Built-in**: TCPA, GDPR, HIPAA-ready architecture

#### Q: How difficult would it be for competitors to replicate?
**A:** While the basic features could be replicated in 6-12 months, our advantages are:
- 18-month head start in AI training data
- Established partner network creating lock-in
- Direct carrier relationships taking months to establish
- Complex real-time infrastructure requiring specialized expertise
- Network effects from marketplace and integrations

#### Q: What happens if OpenAI raises prices or becomes unavailable?
**A:** We've built provider abstraction allowing us to switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and open-source models. Our AI costs are only 5% of revenue, so even a 10x increase would be manageable. We're also fine-tuning smaller models for specific tasks to reduce dependence.

### MARKET & COMPETITION

#### Q: Why hasn't someone built this before?
**A:** Three key enablers just converged:
1. **AI Breakthrough** (2023): GPT-4 made conversational AI practical
2. **WebRTC Maturity** (2022): Browser-based calling became reliable
3. **Carrier APIs** (2021): SignalWire/Twilio made wholesale rates accessible

Enterprise vendors (Five9, RingCentral) focus upmarket where they charge 10x more. They have no incentive to cannibalize their $200+/seat revenue.

#### Q: What's stopping Five9 or RingCentral from competing?
**A:** Classic innovator's dilemma:
- They make $200-500/agent vs. our $29-99
- Their enterprise sales process takes months vs. our self-service
- They'd cannibalize existing revenue to compete
- Their cost structure can't support our pricing
- By the time they react, we'll have 25,000+ customers and network effects

#### Q: How big is the real addressable market?
**A:** Our TAM analysis:
- **125,000** small call centers (10-100 agents) in US = $3.75B
- **2.3M** businesses with sales teams = $4.6B
- **900,000** healthcare practices = $2.7B
- **106,000** real estate brokerages = $1.3B
- **Total SAM**: $12.3B in North America alone

Even capturing just 2% = $246M revenue opportunity.

#### Q: Who is your biggest competitive threat?
**A:** Our biggest threats in order:
1. **Aircall** raising $120M and moving downmarket (monitoring closely)
2. **New AI-first startup** with significant funding (18-month window)
3. **Twilio** launching a packaged solution (unlikely due to channel conflict)
4. **Microsoft Teams** adding call center features (too enterprise-focused)

### BUSINESS MODEL & ECONOMICS

#### Q: How sustainable is the 17.8x LTV/CAC ratio?
**A:** Very sustainable because:
- **Low CAC**: Self-service model with 14% trial conversion
- **High Retention**: 115% net revenue retention from upsells
- **Natural Expansion**: Customers add agents as they grow
- **Sticky Product**: Deep operational integration makes switching painful
- Similar SaaS companies (Zoom, Slack) maintained 10x+ ratios at scale

#### Q: What's driving the 75% gross margin?
**A:** Our cost structure:
- **Voice/SMS**: $0.0065/minute wholesale (vs. $0.02 retail)
- **Infrastructure**: 7% of revenue on Supabase/Vercel
- **AI Costs**: $0.002 per 1K tokens (5% of revenue)
- Margins improve to 85% at scale through volume discounts

#### Q: Why won't customers just use free alternatives?
**A:** Free tools (Google Voice, Skype) lack:
- Call recording and compliance features
- Team management and permissions
- Analytics and reporting
- CRM integrations
- Professional phone numbers
- Customer support

Our $29-99/month is negligible vs. the value of professional features.

#### Q: How do you prevent churn?
**A:** Multi-layered retention strategy:
- **Deep Integration**: Becomes part of daily workflow
- **Data Lock-in**: Call history, recordings, analytics
- **Team Adoption**: Multiple users create organizational inertia
- **Continuous Value**: AI improvements, new features monthly
- **White-label**: Partners have their brand reputation at stake

### GO-TO-MARKET & GROWTH

#### Q: Why will customers trust a startup with their phone system?
**A:** Several factors build trust:
- **Free Trial**: Try before buying reduces risk
- **Month-to-month**: No annual contracts required
- **White-label**: Many customers won't know we're a startup
- **Carrier Redundancy**: Automatic failover between providers
- **Quick Win**: ROI visible in first week of use

#### Q: How will you acquire customers cost-effectively?
**A:** Three-pronged approach:
1. **Product-Led Growth**: Free tier drives viral adoption
2. **Partner Channel**: Agencies bring their clients (30% of growth)
3. **Content/SEO**: Ranking #1 for "affordable call center software"

Current CAC of $180 includes all channels. Pure organic CAC is under $50.

#### Q: What's the white-label strategy?
**A:** White-label is our secret weapon:
- Digital agencies can offer "their own" call center platform
- 20% recurring revenue share incentivizes promotion
- Partners handle customer support for their clients
- Each partner brings 10-50 customers on average
- Target: 500 partners = 10,000+ customers

#### Q: How quickly can you scale sales?
**A:** Our sales model is highly scalable:
- **Self-service**: 60% of customers never talk to sales
- **Product-qualified leads**: Users who hit limits upgrade naturally
- **Inside sales**: 2-week ramp for new reps
- **Partner leverage**: Each partner is effectively multiple salespeople
- At $50M ARR, we'll need only 30 sales reps (vs. 100+ for competitors)

### FINANCIAL & INVESTMENT

#### Q: Why raise $3.5M now vs. bootstrapping?

#### Q: What's the realistic exit timeline?
**A:** Multiple exit opportunities:

- **Year 5**: Major acquisition at $400M (8x ARR)
- **Year 7**: PE rollup at $600M+

Most likely: Strategic acquisition by RingCentral/Five9/Zoom in Years 3-5.

#### Q: What are the biggest risks to the investment?

4. **Regulation**: Built-in compliance, legal counsel engaged
5. **Market**: Growing 23% annually, recession-resistant (cost-saving tool)

### STRATEGIC QUESTIONS

#### Q: Why not focus on enterprise where there's more money?
**A:** Strategic choice to start with SMB:
- **Faster Sales Cycles**: 14 days vs. 6-9 months
- **Product Iteration**: 100x more customer feedback
- **Lower CAC**: $180 vs. $15,000+
- **Bigger Market**: 10M SMBs vs. 10K enterprises

Patents in communication software rarely provide real protection.

- **English-speaking first**: UK, Australia, Canada (minimal localization)
- **Europe**: GDPR-compliant architecture ready
- **LatAm**: Large SMB market, Spanish localization planned
- **Asia**: Partnership strategy due to regulatory complexity

International could add 50% to TAM.

#### Q: What keeps you up at night?
**A:** Our biggest concerns:
1. **Execution Speed**: Moving fast enough to capture market
2. **Talent Acquisition**: Finding A+ players quickly
3. **Platform Risk**: Over-dependence on any single provider
4. **Customer Success**: Maintaining quality at scale
5. **Competition**: Well-funded competitor with similar vision

**A:** Current cap table:

- **Employees**: 10% 
- **Advisors**: 5%
- **Seed Investors**: 10% ($500K at $2M post)

Clean cap table with no problematic terms.

#### Q: What's the use of funds if you raise less/more?

We're confident in executing with $2.5M but $3.5M optimizes growth.
